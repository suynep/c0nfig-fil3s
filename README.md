## How to use?


As you might've noticed, the files are named more for the sake of understandability than for their actual `system` name.

For instance, tmux's config file, which should be under `$HOME/.tmux.conf` is simply name `tmux-file`.

To link the files to actual directory with actual syntatical name, use:

`ln <file_name> <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE_IN_SYS>` then voila!
